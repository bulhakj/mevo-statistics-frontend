Hello!

This is frontend layer of mevo-statistics. It's an app to show statistics of Mevo service (electric bikes) in Pomeranian 
voivodeship in Poland.
In this project I'm using React.
Packages used: axios, styled-components, react-geolocated and chart.js. 
Project is still in progress.
 I'm developing it in collaboration with @arkadiuszSzast who is caring about backend layer(link to his profile and repository https://github.com/arkadiuszSzast/mevo-statistics)
